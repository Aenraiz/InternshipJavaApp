 <h2> Description (CLI appplication) </h2>
This program is designed to allow students at the University of South Carolina to easily search for and find jobs related to their major. The program is written in java and outputs to a terminal.

<h2> Overview </h2>
The system will be compiled and executed on a single machine using Java. The system will be designed in a Visual Studio Code supporting Java development and teamwork. The entire system will reside on a single machine and it will receive input from the terminal console.

<h2>Workflow</h2> 
All Commits to the branch are done via PRs.

 - No direct commits 
<h3> But, why not allow direct commits and only do PRs? </h3>

- Easier to know who did what 
- Easier to see all the changes made in a branch on one page
- Integrates easily with github actions and automating unit tests and creates an extremely smooth ci/cd experience
- Easier to make the connections between Trello board assignments and actual changes in the code.
- Most importantly, it forces you to OWN YOUR CODE. If the code in your commits are written with best practices, let it be known and easy to see that you know what you're doing.
